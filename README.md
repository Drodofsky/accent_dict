# accent-dict.jp
A Rust library for parsing and interpreting the [Monokakido](https://www.monokakido.jp/en/dictionaries/app/) dictionary format.

## Notice

This library started as a personal project driven by curiosity.
It is NOT intended to support piracy;
I strongly condemn making unauthorized copies of Monokakido's dictionaries,
and take no part or responsibility in that kind of activity.
Please buy your dictionaries directly from Monokakido to show your love and support.
